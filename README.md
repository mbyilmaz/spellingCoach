# spellingCoach

Spelling Coach is an android mobile app aimed at helping elementary and middle school students in their self study for the 
school spelling bee competitions. 

The app includes a short word list but users can create their custom lists as well. The app will cycle through the words 
asking for the users to spell the words under changing difficulty conditions. There are 4 difficulty levels:

1. The word will be shown on screen continuously. Spelled letters will be shown on screen.
1. The word will briefly appear on screen. Spelled letters will be shown on screen.
1. The word will be prompted only by sound. Spelled letters will be shown on screen.
1. The word will be prompted only by sound. Spelled letters will not be shown on screen. 
 
The app will keep track of the users' responses and increase or decrease the difficulty of each word individually. Learned words
will be removed from the study list and continued to be tested through spelling quizzes.
